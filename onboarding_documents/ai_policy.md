# **Educational Institution AI Use Policy**

### **Purpose**

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including tools like ChatGPT, offers unprecedented opportunities for enhancing learning experiences. However, these technologies also present challenges to academic integrity and the fundamental learning objectives of our institution. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines for the responsible use of AI tools within our educational community.

### **Scope**

This policy applies to all participants enrolled in modules at the Data Sciences Institute, across all levels and modalities of study.

### **Policy Statement**

1. **Prohibited Use**: The use of AI tools (e.g., chatbots like ChatGPT, AI writing and research assistants, etc.) for completing assignments, quizzes, homework, examinations, or any other forms of assessment is strictly prohibited. This is to ensure that the work submitted is reflective of a participantâ€™s own knowledge, understanding, and critical thinking skills.

2. **Permissible Use for Learning**:
   - **Self-Learning and Practice**: participants are permitted to use AI tools for the purposes of self-learning, practice, and understanding complex concepts. AI can serve as a supplementary resource for exploring module materials more deeply.
   - **Research and Inquiry**: AI tools may be used for gathering preliminary insights or understanding diverse perspectives on research topics. However, the use of such tools should not replace primary research methodologies or direct engagement with academic texts.

3. **Disclosure Requirement**: If a participant uses an AI tool to assist with any aspect of their module work (excluding prohibited uses), they must disclose this usage clearly. The disclosure should include:
   - A brief description of the nature of the AI assistance.
   - The specific purpose for which the AI was consulted.
   - A reflection on how the AI tool contributed to their learning process or enhanced their understanding of the subject matter.

### **Guidance for participants**

Participants are encouraged to critically assess the information provided by AI tools, recognizing that such information may be inaccurate or biased.

In any instance where AI assistance is disclosed, participants should demonstrate their own critical engagement with the material and articulate their personal insights or conclusions.

### **Compliance and Consequences**

Failure to adhere to this policy will be considered a violation of academic integrity and may result in disciplinary actions, including but not limited to, grade penalties, module failure, or more severe academic sanctions.

### **Review and Modification**

This policy is subject to review and revision to adapt to the evolving landscape of AI technologies and their implications for education. Feedback from the educational community is welcome to ensure the policy remains relevant and effective.
