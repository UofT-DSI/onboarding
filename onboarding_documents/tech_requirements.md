# Technology Requirements 

## Computer 

Learners should have access to a personal computer <u>**with admin privileges**</u>. For the bare minimum specifications required to run Python scripts and R files throughout an entire session, you might consider the following:
  - **RAM:** 4GB is the absolute minimum, but it's important to be aware of performance limitations, especially when dealing with larger data sets or more complex scripts.
  - **Storage:** A minimum of 25GB of storage is necessary. An HDD would suffice, though an SSD would provide better performance, albeit not essential.
  - **CPU:** The bare minimum would be a basic dual-core processor, such as an older generation Intel Pentium, or an AMD A6 or AMD Athlon processor.
  - **Operating System:** Any modern operating system that supports Python and R is required. This includes older versions of Windows (like Windows 10), macOS (High Sierra 10.13), or Linux distributions. The operating system should be stable and compatible with the programming software in use. It's advisable to avoid ChromeOS, Android OS, and iPadOS; although they can handle these tasks, they do not support out-of-the-box usage, and the effort required for setup and operation is not justifiable. Additionally, these operating systems are not commonly used in the industry for such tasks. 

## Internet Connection 

Reliable and high-speed internet access is essential for downloading software, accessing online materials, and participating in virtual classes. 

To ensure a smooth learning experience, we recommend a minimum internet connection speed of:

  * 10 Mbps Download
  * 5 Mbps Upload

## GitHub Account 

All course content will be housed on the DSI GitHub: https://github.com/UofT-DSI 

Learners must make a GitHub account at the following page if they don't already have one: https://github.com/ 
  * Sign Up: On the GitHub homepage, you'll find a "Sign up" button. Click on it.
  * Create a GitHub Account: You'll be prompted to enter your information: 
    * Username: Choose a unique username that will identify you on GitHub. 
    * Email address: Provide a valid email address. 
    * Password: Create a secure password. 
* Select the free plan 

## Google Colab

Courses that involve Python will be utilizing Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. This decision is based on its user-friendly nature and its readiness for use right out of the box.

To ensure a smooth learning experience, learners are required to have a Google account. If they don't already have one, they can create it by following these steps:

  * Visit https://google.com/
  * Click on the "Sign in" button on the Google homepage.
  * Instead of signing in, select the "Create account" option.
  * Follow the prompts to set up your Google account.

## Software Requirements 

Your instructors will provide you with the specific software requirements at the beginning of each course, and will walk you through the steps on how to install the necessary software for that course.

## Pre-Course Assignments 

Some of the courses in this program include pre-course work to help you prepare for the upcoming sessions. Your instructor will email you with specific details about the pre-work assignments for each course.
