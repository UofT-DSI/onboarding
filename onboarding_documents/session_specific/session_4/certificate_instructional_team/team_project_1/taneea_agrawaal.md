I am a Climate Researcher and Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science at University of Toronto, working at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Climate Change. Currently in my work, I am examining the creation, use and impact of climate data, modelling and related technologies in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). This work touches upon research areas in climate informatics, climate risk and resilience, civic technologies, data infrastructures and critical design. In a past life, I worked at Goldman Sachs. I pursued my Bachelors at IIIT Delhi, and am an alumnus of Rails Girls Summer of Code and profoundly influenced by the open source community. I am an active participant of Diversity in Tech and have worked extensively with many initiatives like Indian Women in Engineering@GS, Rails Girls, Women TechMakers by Google. I am passionate about diversity in tech and have attended and spoken at numerous conferences and I possess management and organisational experience.
