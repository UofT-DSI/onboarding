Hello! I’m Ananya, a 2023 graduate from the University of Toronto with a double major in Computer Science and Statistics, along with a minor in Math. In the past, I've worked as a Software Developer and Data Scientist at Citi, BMO, and RBC Capital Markets. Currently, I’m a Machine Learning Engineer at Shopify, diving into the exciting world of large language models (LLMs). Outside of work, I’m passionate about advocating for women in tech, enjoy photography, love listening to music, and recently began exploring DJing. I’ve been with DSI for almost a year now and have met some incredibly cool, curious learners. Excited to keep connecting with even more amazing people!
