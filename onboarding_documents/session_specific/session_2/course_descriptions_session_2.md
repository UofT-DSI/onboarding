Additionally, it will examine common data management concerns, data access management, and data privacy adherence. Learners will be introduced to principles around reproducibility, sharing data, and data ethics (for example, respecting those whose data we use). This module topic will also cover professional skills such as communication (with a variety of stakeholders) and documentation

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Develop a better understanding of the structure of databases.
- Save and transport data in CSV and JSON file formats.
- Familiarity with querying and manipulating data in SQL.
- Familiarity with the legal framework around sharing data.
- Analyze data requirements and work with different stakeholders such as analysts and managers.

### Estimation, Machine Learning, and Testing
This module topic provides the skills required to design, implement, test and validate a variety of supervised learning models. The basics of statistical learning including modelling with the goal of prediction versus inference, prediction accuracy and model interpretability trade-off, and the all-important bias-variance trade-off will be covered. Each section of this module topic will address a unique set of methods used for supervised learning on real data sets. 

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand, implement, and interpret the results from several supervised learning approaches for regression and classification.
- Utilize resampling methods to extract more information from a data set and to choose the best model.
