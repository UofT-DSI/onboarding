# Program Evaluation 

We are committed to continuous improvement of our certificate program. Your feedback is crucial in helping us enhance the learning experience. Throughout this 16-week process, we kindly request you to take some time to provide your insights through our program evaluation process. Please note: All survey responses will be kept confidential and individual, identifiable data will not be shared publicly.  

* Intake Survey: Before the program officially begins, you are required to take our intake survey. This survey is designed to gather information about your background, expectations, and goals. Your responses will help us tailor the program to better meet your needs and evaluate how much you’ve changed by the end of the program. 

* Mid-Program Survey: Around the midpoint of the program, you will be asked to complete a mid-program evaluation survey. This provides an opportunity to share your thoughts on the content, delivery, and overall experience thus far. 

* End-of-Program Evaluation: Upon completion of the program, you will receive an end-of-program evaluation form. This comprehensive survey will cover various aspects of the program, including module content, technical facilitator effectiveness, and program logistics, as well as competency questions to determine the program’s impact on your knowledge. 

* Post Program Survey: We value your journey beyond program completion. After finishing the program, we will invite you to participate in the mandatory post-program survey to capture insights into your post program experiences including your current employment status and salary.  

We will include the links to each survey here once they are available and will also email them to all learners.
